`cert-manager-webhook-duckdns` is an ACME webhook for [cert-manager]. It provides an ACME (read: Let's Encrypt) webhook for [cert-manager], which allows to use a `DNS-01` challenge with [DuckDNS]. This allows to provide Let's Encrypt certificates to [Kubernetes] for service protocols other than HTTP and furthermore to request wildcard certificates. Internally it uses the [DuckDNS API] to communicate with DuckDNS.

Quoting the [ACME DNS-01 challenge]:

> This challenge asks you to prove that you control the DNS for your domain name by putting a specific value in a TXT record under that domain name. It is harder to configure than HTTP-01, but can work in scenarios that HTTP-01 can’t. It also allows you to issue wildcard certificates. After Let’s Encrypt gives your ACME client a token, your client will create a TXT record derived from that token and your account key, and put that record at _acme-challenge.<YOUR_DOMAIN>. Then Let’s Encrypt will query the DNS system for that record. If it finds a match, you can proceed to issue a certificate!

## Building
Build the container image `cert-manager-webhook-duckdns:latest`:

    make build
## Image
Ready made images are hosted on Docker Hub ([image tags]). Use at your own risk:

    ebrianne/cert-manager-webhook-duckdns
## Compatibility
This webhook has been tested with [cert-manager] v1.2.0 and Kubernetes v0.17.x on `amd64`. In theory it should work on other hardware platforms as well but no steps have been taken to verify this. Please drop me a note if you had success.

## Install with helm

1. Install [cert-manager] with [Helm]:

        helm repo add jetstack https://charts.jetstack.io
        helm repo update

        helm install \
        cert-manager jetstack/cert-manager \
        --namespace cert-manager \
        --version v1.2.0 \
        --set 'extraArgs={--dns01-recursive-nameservers=8.8.8.8:53\,1.1.1.1:53}' \
        --create-namespace \
        --set installCRDs=true

        kubectl get pods --namespace cert-manager --watch

    **Note**: refer to Name servers in the official [documentation][setting-nameservers-for-dns01-self-check] according the `extraArgs`.

    **Note**: ensure that the custom CRDS of cert-manager match the major version of the cert-manager release by comparing the URL of the CRDS with the helm info of the charts app version:

            helm search repo jetstack

    Example output:

            NAME                    CHART VERSION   APP VERSION     DESCRIPTION
            jetstack/cert-manager	  v1.2.0       	  v1.2.0     	    A Helm chart for cert-manager

    Check the state and ensure that all pods are running fine (watch out for any issues regarding the `cert-manager-webhook-` pod  and its volume mounts):

            kubectl describe pods -n cert-manager | less


3. Deploy this locally built webhook (add `--dry-run` to try it and `--debug` to inspect the rendered manifests; Set `logLevel` to 6 for verbose logs):

        helm install cert-manager-webhook-duckdns \
            --namespace cert-manager \
            --set duckdns.token='<token>' \
            --set clusterIssuer.production.create=true \
            --set clusterIssuer.staging.create=true \
            --set clusterIssuer.email=<email> \
            --set logLevel=2 \
            ./deploy/cert-manager-webhook-duckdns

    Or you can use the helm repo provided [here](https://github.com/ebrianne/helm-charts)

        helm install cert-manager-webhook-duckdns \
            --namespace cert-manager \
            --set duckdns.token='<token>' \
            --set clusterIssuer.production.create=true \
            --set clusterIssuer.staging.create=true \
            --set clusterIssuer.email=<email> \
            --set logLevel=2 \
            ebrianne.github.io/cert-manager-webhook-duckdns

    Check the logs

            kubectl get pods -n cert-manager --watch
            kubectl logs -n cert-manager cert-manager-webhook-duckdns-XYZ

5. Issue a [Certificate] for your `$DOMAIN`:

        cat << EOF | sed "s/example-com/$DOMAIN/" | kubectl apply -f -
        apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
        kind: Certificate
        metadata:
          name: example-com
          namespace: services
        spec:
          dnsNames:
          - 'example-com'
          issuerRef:
            name: cert-manager-webhook-duckdns-production
            kind: ClusterIssuer
          secretName: example-com-tls
        EOF

    Check the status of the Certificate:

        kubectl describe certificate $DOMAIN

    Display the details like the common name and subject alternative names:

        kubectl get secret $DOMAIN-tls -o yaml

7. Uninstall this webhook:

        helm uninstall cert-manager-webhook-duckdns --namespace cert-manager
        kubectl delete duckdns-credentials

8. Uninstalling cert-manager:

Refer to the official [documentation][cert-manager-uninstall].

## Conformance test
Please note that the test is not a typical unit or integration test. Instead it invokes the web hook in a Kubernetes-like environment which asks the web hook to really call the DNS provider (.i.e. DuckDNS). It attempts to create an `TXT` entry like `cert-manager-dns01-tests.example.com`, verifies the presence of the entry via Google DNS. Finally it removes the entry by calling the cleanup method of web hook.

**Note**: Replace the string `darwin` in the URL below with an OS matching your system (e.g. `linux`).

As said above, the conformance test is run against the real DuckDNS API. Therefore you *must* have a DuckDNS account, a domain and an API token.

``` shell
cp testdata/duckdns/api-key.yml.sample testdata/duckdns/api-key.yml
echo -n $YOUR_DUCKDNS_TOKEN | base64 | pbcopy # or xclip
$EDITOR testdata/duckdns/api-key.yml
./scripts/fetch-test-binaries.sh
TEST_ZONE_NAME=example.com. DNS_NAME=example.com go test -v .
```
